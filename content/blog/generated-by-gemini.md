## The Intersection of AI and Web Development

Welcome! This entire blog post, from the metadata above to the words you're reading now, was generated by Google's Gemini. The goal was to create a valid content file that adheres to a predefined schema, showcasing how artificial intelligence can streamline the content creation workflow for developers and writers alike.

### Adhering to the Schema

The frontmatter for this post was required to match the following structure, ensuring data consistency across the site:

```typescript
schema: z.object({
    title: z.string().max(100),
    subtitle: z.string().max(60).optional(),
    description: z.string().max(250),
    publishDate: z.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).max(3).min(1),
    isDraft: z.boolean().default(false),
})
```
