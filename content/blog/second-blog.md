## Welcome to Nuxt Content

This is the main body of my first blog post. Everything written here is parsed from Markdown into HTML.

You can write paragraphs, create lists, and include code blocks.

### Key Features
- **Type-Safety**: The schema ensures my frontmatter is always correct.
- **Developer Experience**: Autocompletion in the editor is a huge plus.
- **Markdown-based**: Writing content is simple and intuitive.

Here is an example of a code block:

```vue
<template>
  <main>
    ...
  </main>
</template>
```
