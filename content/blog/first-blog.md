This is the main body of my first blog post. Everything written here is parsed from Markdown into HTML. You can write paragraphs, create lists, and include code blocks.

### Key Features
- **Type-Safety**: The schema ensures my frontmatter is always correct.
- **Developer Experience**: Autocompletion in the editor is a huge plus.
- **Markdown-based**: Writing content is simple and intuitive.

Here is an example of a code block:

```vue
<template>
  <main>
    ...
  </main>
</template>
```
